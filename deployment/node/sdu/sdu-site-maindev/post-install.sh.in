# 1, Checkout http://svn.secca-project.com/public/trunk/ to
#       PKGDATA/html
#    cuz devsite will always run on the main-dev, so we can safely checkout
#    from the local repository.
#
#    Instead of checkout from /repos/svn (which is provided by serv-seccasvn,
#    we will get from /mnt/devdata/svnrepo instead. )
#
#    Switch between either is easy cuz the UUID is always the same.
